########## 1> Routing :- it is the technique to move form one page to another page in webpages. 

routing in react and routing in next.js are different . 
we perform routing in react by the help of react-router-dom package inside Routes in app.jsx

but in next.js react router dom is inbuilt functionality where we perform routing simply in page.js
we need to make a componanent with same name as main file. hence routing is done in next.js 

for example :- we have main file named as page.js 
               if we want make a about section then first make about folder inside app and make page.js file inside about folder. and write your about content.

hence routing done in next.js  

Note :- your route name will be similar as your folder name like in abouve case /about your route as your folder name is about.

########## 2> nested routing :- Routing inside routing 
    
    To perform nested routing in next.js we have to perform the sme steps as we did to make a our route.

    for example :- inside 
                   /Project there are two more route /fuelfit and /food_paradise . to reach out to fuelfit we have to write our route /Project/fuelfit inside project folder in page.js

                   /Project ----> /Project/fuelfit ----> /Project/fuelfit/aboutfuelfit        it is the nexted routing.

########## 3> dynamic routing 
         
       
       it is routing that involves any route after / . it means in this we dont have to specified our route. we just use / ( anything name or string).

       to use dynamic route we have to make a folder name as [ with anyname ].

########## 4> next.js supportes both client side and server side renderring that's why we have to mention at the top of file either we are using client side renderring or server side renderring  

 and all the hooks comes under in client side renderring that's why we have to mention 'use client' before using any hooks in next.js
       
########## 5> API fetching in next.js 

   in sevrer component we can use async or it highly recommended to use fetch() function for fetching the data. because fetch() provide  all other functionality also rather than  fetching only in next.js
   
   const data = await fetch();
   const data1 = await data.json();

   basically it all done in server componanent

   but we can do this in client componanent with the help of use() hook and we dont need to use async or await 

   client componanent :- run two times one in server to get the data then in client (browser) that is called streaming the data from server to client.
   server componanent :- run only once in server to get the data.

######### 6> creating a api route in the next.js 

 like if we want a api route like this api/posts 
     then we have to make folder structure like this 
            
            first api folder then inside posts folder make route.js file.

######### 7> json placeholder :- collection of fake api for the testing and prototyping.

######### 8> always place a component folder inside src directory . not inside app directory.

######### 9> always takecare of folder structure and convention so that anyone can see and easily understand your code. 
             
          --> make a group of files which is in same page. like home page contain navbar , main banner , footer , feature section etc 

               so in home page there are main banner and feature section that are not in other pages. means main banner and feature section are only in homepage not in other page. so make component folder of all those file which is present in homepage. 

               (home) folder --> component folder --> Banner.jsx .
                                 component folder --> Feature.jsx   

              and make all this folder inside app directory. next.js will not consider round bracket () as a route.

          --> now navbar , footer is the files which are present in all page so make this group also outside the app directory but inside src directory.
              
              component folder --> Navbar.jsx .
              component folder --> Footer.jsx .
